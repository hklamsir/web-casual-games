# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project now contains **nine games**: Cat Café Tycoon, Neon Snake 2077, Space Invaders, Emoji Memory Match, Gravity Switch, Quantum 2048, Zen Stack, Synth Flow, and the newly added **Word Weaver** (墨韻織詞).

The latest addition introduces the **word puzzle** genre — a cerebral counterbalance to the collection's arcade-heavy lineup, featuring elegant East Asian ink brush aesthetics.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### ✍️ Word Weaver (New)
*   **Genre**: Word Puzzle / Brain Training.
*   **Architecture**: DOM-based grid with SVG line overlay for path visualization.
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **Letter Grid**: 4x4 (levels 1-3) or 5x5 (levels 4+) grid of letters.
    *   **Swipe-to-Select**: Touch/drag adjacent cells to form words.
    *   **8-Direction Linking**: Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency supported.
    *   **Word Validation**: Only predefined target words count; minimum 3 letters.
    *   **Progressive Levels**: 8 levels with increasing grid size and word count.
*   **Scoring**:
    *   3-letter word: 100 pts
    *   4-letter word: 200 pts
    *   5+ letter word: 300 pts
    *   Level completion bonus: level × 100 pts
*   **Features**:
    *   **Hint System**: Highlights the first letter of an unfound word.
    *   **Shuffle Animation**: Visual feedback for grid interaction.
    *   **Ink Splash Effect**: Celebratory visual on correct word.
*   **Audio**:
    *   **Web Audio API**: Procedural sounds for select, success, fail, and level-up.
    *   **No external audio files required**.
*   **Controls**:
    *   **Touch**: Swipe across adjacent cells.
    *   **Mouse**: Click and drag across cells.

    *   **Ink Brush Aesthetic**: Paper cream background, gold accents, brush-style fonts.

    *   **SVG Connection Lines**: Real-time path visualization with gold stroke.
*   **Mobile Support**:
    *   Touch events with `passive: false` for smooth swipe.
    *   Responsive grid sizing.
    *   Safe area padding for notched devices.

### 🎵 Synth Flow (Previous)
*   **Status**: Released and stable.
*   **No changes in this release.**

## 3. Detailed Review & Suggestions

### ✍️ Word Weaver

#### Pros
*   **Clean State Management**: `GameState` object centralizes all game state.
*   **Elegant Grid Algorithm**: Word placement tries up to 100 random positions per word; fills remaining cells with random letters.
*   **Path Validation**: Adjacency check correctly handles all 8 directions.
*   **Touch/Mouse Parity**: Same selection logic for both input methods.
*   **SVG Line Rendering**: Real-time path visualization during selection.
*   **Visual Polish**: Ink brush theme is distinctive and calming.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Word Dictionary**: Currently uses curated word lists per level. Could expand with a larger dictionary and procedural level generation.
*   **Multilingual Support**: Could add Traditional Chinese character mode (成語, 詞語).
*   **Score Persistence**: No local storage for high scores yet.
*   **Undo Selection**: Allow tapping on the last selected cell to undo.
*   **Used Letters Visual**: Mark letters that are part of found words (e.g., gray out or fade).

### Code Quality Notes
*   **Event Handling**: Touch events use `preventDefault()` to avoid scrolling — correct.
*   **Performance**: SVG re-rendering on resize is handled; no memory leaks observed.
*   **Accessibility**: Could add `aria-label` to grid cells for screen readers.
