### 🌌 Gravity Switch (Polish)
*   **Difficulty Curve**: Adjusted obstacle spawn rate at low levels (33 frames) for a smoother learning curve.

## 3. Detailed Review: Neon Drift

#### Pros
*   **Satisfying Game Loop**: The simple one-tap mechanic is highly addictive and fits the "casual" criteria perfectly.
*   **Responsive Physics**: The 45-degree movement feels predictable and fair.
*   **Visual Polish**: The glowing neon edges and trail effects provide high visual quality with minimal assets.
*   **Optimized Performance**: Canvas rendering is efficient; handles high speed without frame drops.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Visual Variety**: Could add color shifts (e.g., from Cyan to Pink) as the player progresses or reaches milestones.
*   **Obstacles**: Adding stationary obstacles on the path could increase difficulty.
*   **Sound**: Currently lacks audio. Should add "drift" sound and "collection" chime.
