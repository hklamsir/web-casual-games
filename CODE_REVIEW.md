# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project now contains seven games: **Cat Café Tycoon**, **Neon Snake 2077**, **Space Invaders**, **Emoji Memory Match**, **Gravity Switch**, **Quantum 2048**, and the newly added **Zen Stack**.
The repository continues to expand with diverse genres. The focus remains on lightweight, mobile-first web experiences.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### 🧱 Zen Stack (New)
*   **Genre**: Physics / Stacking / Rhythm.
*   **Architecture**: Canvas 2D API.
*   **Logic**: 
    *   Block slicing mechanics: Calculates overlap between current and previous block.
    *   Debris generation: The "sliced off" part becomes a physical object that falls with gravity.
    *   Camera Logic: Smoothly lerps (linear interpolation) upwards to keep the stack focus in the lower third of the screen.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Pastel "Zen" color palette.
    *   Simple shading (top highlight, bottom shadow) to give a pseudo-3D look.
*   **Mobile Support**:
    *   Full-screen tap/touch input.
    *   Prevents double-tap zooming via CSS and JS event handling.

### ⚛️ Quantum 2048 (Previous)
*   **Status**: Released.
*   **Feedback**: Smooth animations and responsive layout are working well.

## 3. Detailed Review & Suggestions

### 🧱 Zen Stack
*   **Pros**:
    *   **Core Loop**: The "perfect hit" vs "slicing" mechanic creates immediate feedback and tension.
    *   **Visual Feedback**: The falling debris adds a satisfying "weight" to mistakes.
    *   **Performance**: Uses object pooling (cleanup) for debris, ensuring long-term stability.
*   **Cons**:
    *   **Sound**: Currently silent. Adding a musical note that scales up the scale on perfect hits (Combo) would massively improve the "Zen" feel.
    *   **Difficulty**: Linear speed increase. Could add varying block sizes or moving base targets for advanced modes.

### General Project Health
*   **Shared Assets**: Still pending a move to a shared `common/` directory for styles and utility scripts.
*   **Accessibility**: Added `aria-label` to some buttons, but could be improved across all games.

## 4. Next Steps
1.  **Audio Integration**: Add procedural sound effects (synth tones) to *Zen Stack* for the combo mechanic.
2.  **Refactor**: Create a `common.css` file to unify the "Back to Hall" button and "Game Over" modal styles.
3.  **Deployment**: Push changes to GitHub Pages.
