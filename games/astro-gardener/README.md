# Astro-Gardener

A casual web-based simulation game where players manage a greenhouse on an alien planet, cultivating exotic flora and adapting to environmental challenges.

## Genre
Sci-Fi Gardening / Resource Management Simulation

## Concept
Players are tasked with establishing and maintaining a thriving greenhouse on a distant exoplanet. They must select, plant, and nurture alien plant species, each with unique requirements for water, light, and temperature. Success depends on managing limited resources, adapting to unpredictable planetary weather patterns, researching new technologies, and fulfilling export orders.

## Key Features
*   **Alien Flora**: Diverse plant species with unique properties, growth cycles, and potential for mutations.
*   **Dynamic Environment**: Dynamic weather system (solar flares, dust storms, alien rain) that directly impacts plant growth and resource availability.
*   **Resource Management**: Balance water, nutrients, energy, and research points to ensure optimal greenhouse operations.
*   **Mutation System**: Plants can randomly mutate, leading to new varieties with enhanced or altered characteristics.
*   **Research Tree**: Unlock new technologies to improve irrigation, lighting, defense against environmental hazards, and unlock new plant species.
*   **Export Orders**: Fulfill specific requests from off-world colonies for rare or abundant produce.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for touch controls and responsive layouts.

## Technology Stack
*   **Game Engine**: Custom JavaScript framework leveraging HTML5 Canvas for rendering.
*   **Graphics**: JavaScript, potentially with SVG for UI elements and static assets.
*   **Audio**: Web Audio API for sound effects and background music.

## How to Play
1.  **Plant Seeds**: Use your starting resources to plant various alien seeds in your greenhouse plots.
2.  **Manage Resources**: Monitor and allocate water, nutrients, and energy to keep your plants healthy.
3.  **Adapt to Environment**: Observe the daily weather report and adjust your strategy. Some plants may thrive in extreme conditions, while others wilt.
4.  **Research**: Invest research points to unlock upgrades like automated irrigation, better lighting, or improved species resistance.
5.  **Harvest & Export**: Once plants mature, harvest them to earn credits or fulfill lucrative export contracts. Watch out for mutations that can yield rare specimens!
6.  **Survive Hazards**: Protect your greenhouse from environmental hazards like solar flares and dust storms.

## Development Status
*   **Phase**: Initial development. Core mechanics implemented in `game.js`.
*   **Next Steps**: Implement a user interface, add more plant species and environmental events, develop the research system, and create game progression/win conditions.
