# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project has reached **13 unique games**. The latest addition, **Neon Angler (霓虹釣客)**, introduces a timing-based arcade mechanic (Fishing), further diversifying the collection. The platform remains stable and performs well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### 🎣 Neon Angler (New)
*   **Genre**: Timing / Arcade Fishing.
*   **Architecture**: Pure Canvas (2D) for both entities and background.
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **Oscillating Hook**: The hook moves horizontally at the top, and the player chooses when to drop it.
    *   **Energy System**: Passive energy drain over time, replenished by catching fish, and penalized by hitting viruses.
    *   **Entity Management**: Pool-based reset logic for fish and viruses to maintain performance.
    *   **Particle System**: Simple physics-based particles for feedback upon catching items.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Cyberpunk "Data Sea" aesthetic.
    *   Glow effects and pulsing animations for entities.
*   **Mobile Support**: One-tap control optimized for mobile interaction.

## 3. Detailed Review: Neon Angler

#### Pros
*   **Unique Interaction**: Different from existing "swipe" or "WASD" games, the "drop and retract" mechanic is intuitive and satisfying.
*   **Dynamic Difficulty**: The combination of passive energy drain and obstacle avoidance creates a natural difficulty curve.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Particle explosions and score updates provide immediate gratification.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Sound Effects**: Currently lacks audio. "Splash" and "Beep" sounds would improve immersion.
*   **Variety**: Currently only one type of fish. Adding rare fish with special abilities (e.g., time slow) would add depth.
*   **Level System**: The game currently uses a score-based survival model without discrete levels.
