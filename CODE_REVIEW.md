# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project has reached a major milestone with **12 unique games**. The latest additions, **Glitch Sorter (電幻修復師)** and **Prism Pulse (棱鏡脈衝)**, have significantly broadened the variety of gameplay mechanics. The platform now features a healthy mix of arcade, puzzle, rhythm, and idle genres.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### 💎 Prism Pulse (New)
*   **Genre**: Match-3 / Collapse Puzzle.
*   **Architecture**: Canvas-based grid rendering with a recursive flood-fill algorithm for match detection.
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **Collapse Logic**: Click any group of 3 or more connected identical prisms to clear them.
    *   **Chain Reactions**: Gravity-based falling tiles and automatic refill from the top.
    *   **Score Scaling**: Quadratic scoring (size * size * 10) encourages players to build larger clusters.
    *   **Progression**: Level-up system with increasing score targets.
    *   **Hint System**: Automated search for the largest available match to assist players.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Neon/Glassmorphism aesthetic with high-contrast glowing colors.
    *   Procedural Hexagonal tile rendering on Canvas.
    *   Scale-based animations for "popping" and "falling" effects.
*   **Mobile Support**: Full touch-screen compatibility with `touchstart` event optimization.

### 🔧 Glitch Sorter (Previous)
*   **Genre**: Arcade Sorting / Reaction.
*   **Update**: Confirmed stability in sorting logic and particle system performance.

## 3. Detailed Review: Prism Pulse

#### Pros
*   **High Polish**: The hexagonal tiles and glowing effects give the game a premium "Cyber-Gem" feel.
*   **Recursive Efficiency**: The flood-fill algorithm for matching is efficient enough for instantaneous results on an 8x8 grid.
*   **User Guidance**: The inclusion of a Hint system and an Instruction modal ensures accessibility for new players.
*   **Responsive Layout**: The canvas dynamically resizes while maintaining square aspect ratios and tile proportions.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Sound Effects**: Like many other modules, audio is currently absent. Adding "Chime" sounds for matches and "Pulse" sounds for level-ups would greatly enhance the experience.
*   **Animation Sophistication**: The falling animation is currently a linear velocity move; adding easing (e.g., bounce) would improve the "juice" of the game.
*   **State Persistence**: Current score and level are not saved in LocalStorage. Adding save states would encourage longer play sessions.
