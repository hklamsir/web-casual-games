# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project now contains six games: **Cat Café Tycoon**, **Neon Snake 2077**, **Space Invaders**, **Emoji Memory Match**, **Gravity Switch**, and the newly added **Quantum 2048**.
The repository continues to expand with diverse genres. The focus remains on lightweight, mobile-first web experiences.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### ⚛️ Quantum 2048 (New)
*   **Genre**: Puzzle / Sliding Block.
*   **Architecture**: DOM-based rendering with CSS Grid and Transforms.
*   **Logic**: 
    *   Standard 2048 merge logic (recursive slide and combine).
    *   State tracked in 2D array, DOM updated via full re-render (optimized for simplicity, though reusing elements for position classes).
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Deep space / Quantum theme using Neon colors.
    *   CSS Animations (`@keyframes appear`) for new tiles.
*   **Mobile Support**:
    *   Implemented custom swipe detection (calculating dx/dy from touch events).
    *   Prevents default scrolling on the game board.

### 🌌 Gravity Switch (New)
*   **Genre**: Endless Runner / Arcade (Gravity Flip mechanics).
*   **Architecture**: Canvas 2D API based rendering.
*   **Performance**: Optimized game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`. Efficient object pooling (removing off-screen obstacles) to maintain stable 60 FPS.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Cyberpunk/Minimalist dark aesthetic using CSS variables.
    *   Dynamic background grid and particle explosion effects on death.
*   **Mobile Support**:
    *   Implements `touchstart` for low-latency input.
    *   `touch-action: none` prevents browser zooming/scrolling during gameplay.

### 🐶 Emoji Memory Match (Previous)
*   **Status**: Stable.
*   **Feedback**: User engagement is high due to simple mechanics.

## 3. Detailed Review & Suggestions

### ⚛️ Quantum 2048
*   **Pros**:
    *   **Aesthetics**: The neon glow and dark background fit the "Quantum" theme perfectly.
    *   **Responsiveness**: Grid adapts well to different screen sizes.
    *   **Usability**: Keyboard arrows and Touch swipes both work seamlessly.
*   **Cons**:
    *   **Animation**: The current rendering logic (clearing/redrawing or minimal reuse) might make merge animations less fluid than a complex transition system.
    *   **End Game**: Currently just shows an overlay. Could add a "Continue?" option or particle effects on 2048 tile.

### 🌌 Gravity Switch
*   **Pros**:
    *   **Controls**: One-tap control scheme is perfect for mobile.
    *   **Juice**: Screen shake or more aggressive particles could enhance impact, but current implementation is clean.
    *   **Responsive**: Canvas resizes dynamically with `window.resize`.
*   **Cons**:
    *   **Difficulty Curve**: The speed increase is linear. Consider adding "phases" or changing patterns to keep it interesting.
    *   **Audio**: Currently lacks sound effects (jump/crash). Adding the `AudioContext` synth from Neon Snake would be a good enhancement.

### General Project Health
*   **Shared Assets**: Still pending a move to a shared `common/` directory for styles and utility scripts.
*   **Accessibility**: Added `aria-label` to some buttons, but could be improved across all games.

## 4. Next Steps
1.  **Audio Integration**: Add procedural sound effects to *Gravity Switch* and *Quantum 2048* (merge sounds).
2.  **Refactor**: Create a `common.css` file to unify the "Back to Hall" button and "Game Over" modal styles.
3.  **Deployment**: Push changes to GitHub Pages.
