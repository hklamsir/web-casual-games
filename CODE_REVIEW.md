# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-10 (Post-Release: Echo Chase)
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project has expanded to **14 unique games**. The latest addition, **Echo Chase (回聲獵人)**, introduces a "visual echolocation" mechanic, providing a unique sensory-based arcade experience. This genre differs significantly from previous entries, focusing on perception and rapid response in a minimalist environment.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### 🦇 Echo Chase (New)
*   **Genre**: Sensory Arcade / Perception.
*   **Architecture**: Canvas (2D) for ripple effects and target rendering.
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **Visual Echolocation**: Targets are invisible in the "dark" (black background) and only revealed when the wavefront of a player-generated ripple (circle) passes over them.
    *   **Ephemeral Visibility**: Targets fade out quickly once revealed, requiring precise and fast clicks.
    *   **Dynamic Difficulty**: Target lifespan and spawn intervals scale with the player's level (every 100 points).
*   **Visuals**:
    *   High-contrast minimalist aesthetic (Neon Blue ripples, Gold targets).
    *   Glow/Bloom effects using `shadowBlur` for targets.
*   **Mobile Support**: Fully touch-responsive; taps generate ripples and check for hits simultaneously.

## 3. Detailed Review: Echo Chase

#### Pros
*   **Innovative Mechanic**: The "reveal-and-fade" system creates a satisfying tension between curiosity (generating ripples) and accuracy (hitting revealed targets).
*   **Minimalist Performance**: Low overhead due to simple geometric shapes, ensuring 60fps even on low-end mobile devices.
*   **Accessibility**: High contrast helps in focus, though it heavily relies on visual timing.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Visual Overload**: Multiple ripples at once can make the screen cluttered. A limit on active ripples or a cooldown could be considered.
*   **Target Logic**: Currently, targets only reveal at the *frontier* of the ripple. Expanding the reveal zone to a small thickness around the radius improves the "feel" of the wave.
*   **Feedback**: Adding a subtle haptic feedback (for mobile) or a specific "sonar" sound effect would greatly enhance the theme.
