# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-11 (Scheduled Auto-Creation)
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project has reached **15 games**. The latest addition, **Stellar Reflector (星際反射)**, introduces a physics-based puzzle shooter mechanic. This fulfills the "Physics Trajectory" target identified in the previous review.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### ☄️ Stellar Reflector (New)
*   **Genre**: Physics Shooter / Puzzle.
*   **Architecture**: HTML5 Canvas (2D) with vector-based reflection logic.
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **Vector Reflection**: Implemented `v' = v - 2(v·n)n` for bouncing the energy ball off rotatable reflectors.
    *   **Rotatable Elements**: Players can drag to rotate reflectors, allowing for precise path planning.
    *   **Obstacle Logic**: Black holes act as "lose-state" zones that subtract energy, requiring careful navigation.
    *   **Energy Management**: Fixed cost per shot + reward per win ensures a "fail-state" loop and encourages efficiency.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Glow/Neon aesthetics consistent with the "Neon" series.
    *   Radial gradients for celestial bodies (Star Core, Black Holes).
    *   Particle system for collisions and wins.
*   **Mobile Support**: Drag-to-rotate interaction optimized for touch screens.

## 3. Detailed Review: Stellar Reflector

#### Pros
*   **Math Accuracy**: The reflection logic correctly handles varying incident angles and pushes the ball out of collision to prevent sticking.
*   **Visual Consistency**: The "Stellar/Space" theme fits perfectly with the existing "Neon/Cyberpunk" sub-theme of the platform.
*   **Level Scaling**: Procedural placement of targets and obstacles ensures replayability without hardcoded levels.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Prediction**: A dotted trajectory line for the *first* reflection would help players plan complex shots.
*   **Sound**: Lacks sound effects for reflections and black hole impacts.
*   **Level Design**: Currently, reflectors are placed randomly; manually designed layouts for later levels would provide better difficulty curves.
