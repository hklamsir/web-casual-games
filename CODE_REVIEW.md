# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project now contains **eight games**: Cat Café Tycoon, Neon Snake 2077, Space Invaders, Emoji Memory Match, Gravity Switch, Quantum 2048, Zen Stack, and the newly added **Synth Flow** (音律流動).

The latest addition introduces the **rhythm/music game** genre to the collection — a significant expansion that brings a completely new gameplay style.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### 🎵 Synth Flow (New)
*   **Genre**: Rhythm / Music Game.
*   **Architecture**: DOM-based note rendering with CSS animations.
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **4-Lane System**: Notes fall from the top to a judgement line at the bottom.
    *   **Judgement Windows**: PERFECT (±30px), GOOD (±60px), MISS (outside window or unplayed).
    *   **Combo System**: Consecutive hits multiply score bonuses.
    *   **Procedural Beatmap**: Algorithmically generated patterns based on BPM and difficulty curve.
*   **Audio**:
    *   **Web Audio API**: Real-time synthesized hit sounds (sine wave for PERFECT/GOOD, sawtooth for MISS).
    *   **No external audio files required** — fully procedural audio.
*   **Controls**:
    *   **Keyboard**: D, F, J, K keys for lanes 1-4.
    *   **Touch**: Four responsive buttons at the bottom of the screen.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   **Synthwave/Cyberpunk Aesthetics**: Neon gradients, glow effects, scanline overlay.
    *   **Color-coded Lanes**: Each lane has a distinct color (pink, purple, cyan, blue).
    *   **Feedback Animations**: Notes explode on hit; feedback text pops with appropriate colors.
*   **Mobile Support**:
    *   Touch-friendly button sizing (70px+ tap targets).
    *   `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent zoom delays.
    *   Responsive layout scales lanes and buttons for smaller screens.

### 🧱 Zen Stack (Previous)
*   **Status**: Released and stable.
*   **No changes in this release.**

## 3. Detailed Review & Suggestions

### 🎵 Synth Flow

#### Pros
*   **Clean Architecture**: IIFE pattern with clear separation of state, config, and DOM elements.
*   **Procedural Generation**: No need for external beatmap files; patterns are generated algorithmically.
*   **Web Audio API**: Lightweight audio with no asset dependencies.
*   **Visual Polish**: The Synthwave aesthetic is cohesive and visually striking.
*   **Performance**: Uses `will-change: top` for GPU-accelerated note movement; `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth updates.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Background Music**: Currently no background track. Future enhancement could add a procedural synthesizer or allow loading a custom audio file with beat detection.
*   **Long Note Support**: Currently only supports single-tap notes. Long notes (hold notes) could add variety.
*   **Difficulty Modes**: Consider adding Easy/Normal/Hard presets that adjust `noteSpeed` and `beatInterval`.
*   **Score Persistence**: No local storage for high scores yet. Could add a leaderboard.

### Code Quality Notes
*   **Keyboard vs Touch Parity**: Both input methods trigger the same `handleLanePress()` function — good consistency.
*   **Memory Management**: Notes are properly cleaned up after hit or miss; no memory leaks observed.
*   **Accessibility**: Could add `aria-label` to touch buttons and keyboard hint text for screen readers.
