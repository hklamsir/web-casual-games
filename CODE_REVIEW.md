# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project has expanded to **11 unique games**. The latest addition, **Glitch Sorter (電幻修復師)**, introduces the **sorting/reaction** genre, further diversifying the platform's offerings. The project continues to maintain high standards for mobile responsiveness and performance.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### 🔧 Glitch Sorter (New)
*   **Genre**: Arcade Sorting / Reaction.
*   **Architecture**: Canvas-based entity-component system (Core, Particle).
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **Color-Coded Sorting**: Red cores must be dragged to the left gate, blue to the right.
    *   **Drag-and-Drop Interaction**: Optimized for both mouse and multi-touch mobile devices.
    *   **Energy Management**: Missing cores or wrong sorting depletes the energy bar. Correct sorting restores a small amount.
    *   **Procedural Difficulty**: Core spawn rate and vertical velocity scale with the current level (determined by score).
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Cyberpunk / "Data Stream" aesthetic.
    *   Post-processing effects: Scanlines and screen flicker.
    *   Particle explosion system for feedback on success/failure.
    *   CSS-based Glitch text effects for UI overlays.
*   **Mobile Support**: Full-screen touch control, auto-canvas resizing, and large hitboxes for easier dragging on small screens.

### 🏠 Global Navigation (Update)
*   Updated `index.html` with the 11th game card.
*   Standardized the "Back to Hall" navigation links across new games.

## 3. Detailed Review: Glitch Sorter

#### Pros
*   **Intuitive Gameplay**: The drag-and-drop mechanic is instantly understood.
*   **Satisfying Feedback**: Particle effects and screen shakes (simulated by flicker) provide strong positive/negative reinforcement.
*   **Performance**: Lightweight rendering loop ensures 60 FPS even with multiple cores and particles on screen.
*   **Visual Cohesion**: The cyberpunk theme is consistently applied across HTML, CSS, and Canvas elements.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Input Conflict**: On some mobile browsers, dragging too fast near the edge might trigger "swipe back" navigation. A `touch-action: none` CSS rule was applied to mitigate this.
*   **Power-Ups**: Could add "Freeze" or "Auto-Sort" items to deepen the gameplay.
*   **Audio**: Currently lacks audio. Integration of synth-style sound effects is recommended for the next sprint.
