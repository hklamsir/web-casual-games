# Code Review Report: Web Casual Games
**Date:** 2026-02-14 (Scheduled Auto-Creation)
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant (OpenClaw)

## 1. Executive Summary
The `web-casual-games` project has reached **16 games**. The latest addition, **Neon Defense (霓虹防線)**, is the collection's first **Tower Defense** game, fulfilling the "Strategy" target identified in the previous review. It features a complete grid-based tower placement system, four unique tower types, and a 10-wave progression system.

## 2. Recent Changes & Fixes

### 🛡️ Neon Defense (New)
*   **Genre**: Tower Defense / Strategy.
*   **Architecture**: HTML5 Canvas with grid-based spatial mapping (12×12 cells).
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **Grid System**: 12×12 grid with predefined enemy path. Towers cannot be placed on path cells.
    *   **Four Tower Types**:
        *   **Laser**: Fast fire rate, single target, low cost (50 energy).
        *   **Blaster**: Splash damage, moderate cost (100 energy).
        *   **Slow**: No damage, applies slow debuff to enemies (75 energy).
        *   **Sniper**: Long range, high damage, high cost (150 energy).
    *   **Wave System**: 10 predefined waves with escalating difficulty (enemy HP scales with wave number).
    *   **Enemy Types**: Normal, Fast, Tank (high HP), Elite (combination).
    *   **Upgrade System**: Towers can be upgraded (damage +50%, range +10%, fire rate -10%) or sold (50% refund).
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Cyberpunk neon aesthetic with cyan/pink/purple color scheme.
    *   Glow effects on towers and projectiles.
    *   Particle explosions on enemy death.
    *   Health bars above enemies.
*   **Mobile Support**: Touch-optimized tower selection and placement. Responsive canvas sizing.

### ☄️ Stellar Reflector
*   **Genre**: Physics Shooter / Puzzle.
*   **Architecture**: HTML5 Canvas (2D) with vector-based reflection logic.
*   **Core Mechanics**:
    *   **Vector Reflection**: Implemented `v' = v - 2(v·n)n` for bouncing the energy ball off rotatable reflectors.
    *   **Rotatable Elements**: Players can drag to rotate reflectors, allowing for precise path planning.
    *   **Obstacle Logic**: Black holes act as "lose-state" zones that subtract energy, requiring careful navigation.
    *   **Energy Management**: Fixed cost per shot + reward per win ensures a "fail-state" loop and encourages efficiency.
*   **Visuals**:
    *   Glow/Neon aesthetics consistent with the "Neon" series.
    *   Radial gradients for celestial bodies (Star Core, Black Holes).
    *   Particle system for collisions and wins.
*   **Mobile Support**: Drag-to-rotate interaction optimized for touch screens.

## 3. Detailed Review: Neon Defense

#### Pros
*   **Strategic Depth**: Four distinct tower types create meaningful choices. The interplay between damage dealers and support (slow) towers rewards thoughtful placement.
*   **Progressive Difficulty**: Wave 1 starts gentle (5 normal enemies), while Wave 10 throws elite enemies mixed with tanks. HP scaling (20% per wave) ensures sustained challenge.
*   **Code Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns—`updateTowers()`, `updateEnemies()`, `updateProjectiles()` run independently. Grid-to-pixel conversion utilities are reusable.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Glow effects, particle explosions, and slow-effect indicators provide immediate gameplay feedback.
*   **Economy Balance**: Tower costs (50-150) and sell values (50%) create meaningful decisions about resource allocation.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Path Visibility**: The enemy path could benefit from animated flow indicators to make direction clearer.
*   **Tower Preview**: When selecting a tower type, highlighting valid placement cells would improve UX.
*   **Sound**: No audio cues for tower firing, enemy death, or wave completion.
*   **Save System**: Progress is not persisted across sessions.

## 4. Detailed Review: Stellar Reflector

#### Pros
*   **Math Accuracy**: The reflection logic correctly handles varying incident angles and pushes the ball out of collision to prevent sticking.
*   **Visual Consistency**: The "Stellar/Space" theme fits perfectly with the existing "Neon/Cyberpunk" sub-theme of the platform.
*   **Level Scaling**: Procedural placement of targets and obstacles ensures replayability without hardcoded levels.

#### Cons / Improvements
*   **Prediction**: A dotted trajectory line for the *first* reflection would help players plan complex shots.
*   **Sound**: Lacks sound effects for reflections and black hole impacts.
*   **Level Design**: Currently, reflectors are placed randomly; manually designed layouts for later levels would provide better difficulty curves.
